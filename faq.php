                What is this?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Linkmarky is a new way to keep track of fun and interesting links. When you find a link that you don't have time to read or explore, save it with the Link Drop chrome extension to have it sent to your inbox later in the day.

                How do I save links?
            </h4>

                You'll need to download the Chrome extension or Firefox extension.

                I never received an email with my links
            </h4>
            <p>
                Make sure you check your spam folder. Also, keep in mind that if you don't have any links saved at the time your drop goes out, you won't receive an email.

                My email arrived on the wrong day!
            </h4>
            <p>
                I'm very sorry about that. The system is likely having trouble determining what timezone you are in. I'm actively working on a fix that will resolve this bug. In the meantime, If you reach out to try Linkmarky@gmail.com with your timezone, I can fix it for you immediately.

            </h4>
            <p>
                Thank you for your support! The best way to support development of LinkDrop is by subscribing to Linkmarky plus or leaving a nice review on the Chrome or Firefox extension store
